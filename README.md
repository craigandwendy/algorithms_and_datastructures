Objectives: The course provides an in-depth understanding of algorithms and data structures. The programming language C is used for the implementation. The course covers the following topics: analysis and complexity, searching, sorting, lists, trees, hashing, dynamic programming and graphs.

Literature: The textbook of the course is Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition, Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leirerson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein, MIT Press and McGraw-Hill, 2009. The book is available at the IfI library and online from inside the UZH network. For the exercises that include C programming you can use as a reference The C programming language, Second Edition, Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

Evaluation: The final exam will be corrected and graded from 1 to 6. The final exam is a closed-book exam. The grade of your final exam is the course grade. Official information from the faculty about the final exam are published at: http://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/general/exams/assessment.html

#

Lectures: The lectures take place every Tuesday 14:00 - 15:45 and Friday 12:15 - 13:45.

Course Material and Announcements: The material (exercises, lecture notes, etc) for this course will be uploaded toOLAT. There, you also find all announcements as we progress through the semester.

Exercise: During the semester, twelve (12) weekly exercises will be handed out and discussed in thirteen (13) labs. The exercises are not part of assessment and students are not required to submit solutions.

Every week new exercise will be published. Students have 1 week to solve the exercise themselves. After a week, the solutions will be discussed in the lab sessions. Each lab lasts 90 minutes: 60 minutes are for tutoring and 30 minutes are for individual consultations.

Labs that are cancelled due to public holidays, are scheduled for different dates.

|        Cancelled lab         |     Resceduled time     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Lab 1, 16:15-18:00 April 17  | 14:00 - 16:00 April 19  |
| Lab 1, 16:15-18:00 May 1     | 14:00 - 16:00 May 3     |
| Lab 4, 14:00 - 15:45 May 18  | 14:00 - 16:00 May 17    |


Office hours: They are settled via prior email arrangement with the assistant of the course. Before you proceed in such an arrangement, if additional support is needed, you can try the following, in the given order: (a) post your questions in the forum, (b) contact your tutor (c) contact the teaching assistant of the course.

### Further useful links and learning materials

Abdul Bari's course helps students (including me) to get a deep understanding about datastructures and algorithms. He is active on multiple channels such as YouTube and Udemy.

Tushar Roy's videos about dynamic programming helped me get a proficient understanding about some dynamic programming problems.

Of course there are many more useful websites and learning materials. The ones listed above are those that I used frequently for preparing this course. Keep in mind that not everything on the internet is correct. Only the definitions and solutions provided by the professer/university is valid.

### Course Review

Datastructures and algorithms is known to be a hard course at any university, so do not expect it to come easy. I still think this is an excellent course, that everyone interested in programming or computer science generally should take. Yes it is a lot of work, but rewarding yourself with a good grade and the won knowledge is totally worth the time (blood and sweat) invested. I warmly recommend taking this course if you have the opportunity as it will make you a better programmer.
